🧠 Live Detection of People Safety using NLP & Deep Learning

This project is a real-time safety detection system that uses **Deep Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to monitor live video and audio input for identifying potential safety threats involving people.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to enhance public or workplace safety by detecting potentially harmful or dangerous situations using AI. It combines **computer vision** to process video frames and **NLP** to analyze speech or audio cues, triggering alerts when a risk is detected.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🎥 **Real-Time Video Surveillance** using Deep Learning (e.g., CNN-based models)
- 🔊 **Audio Analysis** using NLP to detect threatening words or distress in speech
- ⚠️ Alerts triggered on detection of unsafe situations (e.g., physical threats, raised voices, or specific keywords)
- 📈 Logs detection timestamps for review or escalation
- ✅ Can be integrated with existing CCTV or surveillance setups

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Video Feed Processing**  
   - Frames are captured from a live camera or video stream  
   - Deep Learning models detect humans, actions, or abnormal behavior

2. **Audio Feed Analysis**  
   - Microphone captures live speech  
   - NLP is used to transcribe and analyze keywords or tone patterns indicating risk

3. **Safety Risk Detection**  
   - If a threat is identified (e.g., shouting, fighting, or dangerous keywords), the system logs it and sends an alert
